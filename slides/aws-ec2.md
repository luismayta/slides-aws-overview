### EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

- Is a Webservice that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- Reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes.
- Allowing you to quickly scale capacity.
- Both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

### EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

- Changes the economics of computing by allowing you yo pay only for capacity that you actually use.
- Provides developers the tools to build failure resilient Applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

### EC2 - Options

#VSLIDE

### EC2 - On Demand

- Allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.

#VSLIDE

### EC2 - Reserved

- provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for a instance. 1 year or 3 year terms.

#VSLIDE

### EC2 - Spot

- enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.

#VSLIDE

### EC2 - Dedicated Hosts

- Physical EC2 server dedicated for you use, Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

#VSLIDE

### On Demand

- Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 whithout any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
- Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot interrupted.
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

#VSLIDE

### Reserved

- Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
- Applications that require reserved capacity.
- Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

#VSLIDE

### Spot

- Applications that have flexible start and end times.
- Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
- Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

#VSLIDE

### Dedicated Hosts

- Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
- Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
- Can be purchased on-demand (hourly.)
- Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.
